# Contribution Guide

- Fork the repository, create a clone and make sure that you are not working on the `MAIN BRANCH' repository!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username-here}/AI-Summarizer.git
```

```bash
cd Summarizer
```

- It is not good practice to work on the `main` branch. You can create a new branch by using this command

```bash
git checkout -b {name-of-the-branch-here}
```

- Add a stream so you can sync your clone with the original repository (get the latest updates)

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/anayatkhan1/AI-Summarizer.git
```

- Use this command to stay up to date with the original repository (not the fork that you made)

```bash
git pull upstream master
```

- Make your contribution too :)

- Open a Pull Request also.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
